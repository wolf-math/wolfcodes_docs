## Select: the foundation

`SELECT` is how you retrieve data from a table. It's the most important SQL statement you'll learn.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This reads: "Select all columns from the users table." The `*` means "all columns."

## Selecting specific columns

Instead of `*`, you can specify exactly which columns you want:

```sql
SELECT email, name FROM users;
```

This returns only the `email` and `name` columns for each row.

## From: which table?

`FROM` specifies which table to query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM expenses;
SELECT name FROM users;
SELECT amount, description FROM expenses;
```

## Where: filtering rows

`WHERE` lets you filter rows based on conditions. This is where SQL gets powerful:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;
```

This returns only users where the `age` column is greater than 18.

## Comparison operators

SQL supports standard comparison operators:

- `=` (equals)
- `!=` or `<>` (not equals)
- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal)
- `<=` (less than or equal)

```sql
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE amount > 100;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'alice@example.com';
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE amount != 0;
```

## `and`, `or`, `not`

Combine conditions with logical operators:

```sql
-- Both conditions must be true
SELECT * FROM expenses 
WHERE amount > 50 AND category = 'food';

-- Either condition can be true
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE age < 18 OR age > 65;

-- Negate a condition
SELECT * FROM expenses 
WHERE NOT category = 'subscription';
```

You can combine multiple conditions:

```sql
SELECT * FROM expenses 
WHERE amount > 50 
  AND category = 'food' 
  AND created_at > '2024-01-01';
```

## Limit: controlling result size

`LIMIT` restricts how many rows are returned:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

This returns only the first 10 rows. Useful for:
- Testing queries on large tables
- Pagination
- Top-N queries

## Offset: Skipping rows

`OFFSET` skips a number of rows before returning results:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

This skips the first 20 rows, then returns the next 10. Common pattern for pagination:

```sql
-- Page 1: rows 1-10
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;

-- Page 2: rows 11-20
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;

-- Page 3: rows 21-30
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

## Order by: Sorting results

`ORDER BY` sorts the results. Remember: tables have no inherent order, so if you want sorted results, you must use `ORDER BY`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at;
```

By default, `ORDER BY` sorts ascending (lowest to highest). Use `DESC` for descending:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Sort by multiple columns:

```sql
SELECT * FROM expenses 
ORDER BY category, amount DESC;
```

This sorts by `category` first, then by `amount` (descending) within each category.

## Putting it all together

Here's a realistic query combining everything:

```sql
SELECT email, name 
FROM users 
WHERE age >= 18 
  AND created_at > '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

This query:
1. Selects `email` and `name` columns
2. From the `users` table
3. Where age is at least 18 AND created after 2024-01-01
4. Sorted by creation date (newest first)
5. Returns only the first 20 rows

## Common mistakes

### Forgetting `ORDER BY`

```sql
-- ❌ Don't assume order
SELECT * FROM users;

-- ✅ Explicitly order if order matters
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### `NULL` comparisons

```sql
-- ❌ Wrong: NULL comparisons don't work with =
SELECT * FROM users WHERE middle_name = NULL;

-- ✅ Correct: Use IS NULL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE middle_name IS NULL;
```

### String comparisons

```sql
-- SQL string comparisons are case-sensitive in most databases
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'Alice@Example.com';
-- Won't match 'alice@example.com'

-- Use functions for case-insensitive matching
SELECT * FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER('Alice@Example.com');
```

## Reading queries left-to-right

When reading a SQL query, think of it as a pipeline:

```
SELECT    → What columns do I want?
FROM      → Which table?
WHERE     → Which rows? (filtering)
ORDER BY  → How should they be sorted?
LIMIT     → How many?
```

Each clause narrows down the result set.

## Practice schema

For the rest of this guide, we'll use this example schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE expenses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
