Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way to organize code around **objects that bundle data and behavior**. The goal is to model real-world entities, keep related logic together, and make reuse easier.

## What is object-oriented programming?

In OOP:
- Code is structured as **objects** with properties (data) and methods (behavior).
- Core ideas include:
  - **Encapsulation** — hide internal details and expose a clear interface.
  - **Reuse** — share common behavior across multiple objects.
  - **Modeling** — represent real-world entities with state and actions.

## OOP in JavaScript

- JavaScript is **multi-paradigm** — you can mix objects, functions, and functional patterns.
- Classes are **modern syntax built on JavaScript’s prototype system** (no deep dive here).
- OOP is **optional**: use it when it improves clarity and structure, skip it when it doesn’t.

## What this section covers

- Classes and instances  
- Methods and `this`  
- Encapsulation (public vs private)  
- Inheritance  
- Static properties and methods  
- Classes vs plain objects  
- When to (and not to) use OOP  

## What this section does *not* cover

- Prototype manipulation  
- Framework-specific OOP patterns  
- Advanced design patterns (Factory, Observer, etc.)
